# Gesture_controlled_Robotic_Arm

Introduction
This repository contains the code and instructions for building a gesture-controlled robotic arm. The project utilizes computer vision techniques to track hand movements and translate them into instructions for the robotic arm.


The arm uses computer vision to track hand movements and replicate them.
